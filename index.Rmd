All the time and efforts are driven to help othersfacing difficulty in R. We also express our heartfelt gratitude to all the mentors who volunteered to lead and teach us R language. We truly appreciate their time, efforts and commitment. Together, we build a strong team. We expect nothing in return from learners. Just a simple request, if you have been benefitted from these series in any way, please try to give it back to others who are in neeed. Let's build a strong community.
