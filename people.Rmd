### Ishveen Kaur\
MS (University of Texas at RGV, Texas)\
BS (Punjab Agriculture University, India)\

The idea of developing a global education network of learning R was initiated, conceptualised and executed by me. The thought behind this idea was to create a global network / community of people interested in coding where we all can learn from each other and help each other grow.\

There is lot of stuff online, but still large proportion of people face difficulty in learning R, due to lack of interactive and one on one session. This idea led to creation of global interactive platform to bring learners and mentors together, leading to creation R club, consisting of several sessions from basics of R to advanced R.\

My basic responsibilities include communication with mentors and learners in designing schedule and course outline of workshop, co-ordinating the sessions and acting as moderator to cater to needs of both mentors and leaders.\
