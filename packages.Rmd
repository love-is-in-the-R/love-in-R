### R packages for data science  

The tidyverse is an opinionated [**collection of R packages**](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.  

Install the complete tidyverse with:  
`install.packages("tidyverse")`

### **Overview**  

Date-time data can be frustrating to work with in R. R commands for date-times are generally unintuitive and change depending on the type of date-time object being used. Moreover, the methods we use with date-times must be robust to time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other time related quirks, and R lacks these capabilities in some situations. Lubridate makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times and possible to do the things R does not.  

If you are new to lubridate, the best place to start is the [date and times chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) in R for data science.  

### **Installation**  

The easiest way to get lubridate is to install the whole tidyverse:  
`install.packages("tidyverse")`  

Alternatively, install just lubridate:  
`install.packages("lubridate")`  

Or the the development version from GitHub:  
`install.packages("devtools")`  
`devtools::install_github("tidyverse/lubridate")`
